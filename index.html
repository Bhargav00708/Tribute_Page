            <div class="aboutThanos">
                Thanos is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was created by
                writer-artist Jim Starlin, and made his first appearance in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (cover date
                February 1973). An Eternalâ€“Deviant warlord from the moon Titan, Thanos is regarded as one of the most
                powerful beings in the Marvel Universe. He has clashed with many heroes including the Avengers, the
                Guardians of the Galaxy, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men.

            <h3 id="headline">Biography of Thanos</h3>
            <div class="aboutThanos">
                Thanos was born on Saturn's moon Titan as the son of Eternals A'lars and Sui-San; his brother is Eros of
                Titan. Thanos carries the Deviants gene, and as such, shares the physical appearance of the Eternals'
                cousin race. Shocked by his appearance and the belief that he would destroy all life in the universe,
                Sui-San attempted to kill him, but she was stopped by A'lars. During his school years, Thanos was a
                pacifist and would only play with his brother Eros and pets. By adolescence, Thanos had become
                fascinated with nihilism and entropy, worshipping and eventually falling in love with the physical
                embodiment of Mistress Death. As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers through
                his superior scientific knowledge using a combination of mysticism and cybernetic enhancements. He
                also attempted to create a new life for himself by siring many children as well as becoming a pirate. He
                finds no fulfillment in either until he is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his
                offspring and his pirate captain.
